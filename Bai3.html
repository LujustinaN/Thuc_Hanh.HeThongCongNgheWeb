            great is the apple. They say that "an apple a day keeps the doctor away" and they're not kidding!</p>
        <p><img src="images/cai.png" alt="" align="right">Don't forget your vegetables either. Eating vegetables everyday is very good for your
            body. Leafy green vegetables like lettuce are particular good for you. Generally, you should have a balanced
            diet of vegetables, fruits, and so on.</p>
